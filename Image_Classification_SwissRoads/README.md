### **Domain**

Image Classification (supervised and unsupervised models)

### **Data Description**

Swissroads data set which contains several hundreds images of vehicles found in the EPFL - Lausanne area including cars, trucks, vans, bikes, motorcycles and others.

### **Problem Statement**

The goal of this project is to test different classifiers and techniques using high-level features extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network from TensorFlow Hub and compare the results with a ConvNet trained from the raw image pixels.
